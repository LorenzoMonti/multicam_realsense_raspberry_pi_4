# multicam_realsense_raspberry_pi_4

Tiny script for [pyrealsense2](https://pypi.org/project/pyrealsense2/), used to capture rgb and depth images from two [Intel Realsense D415](https://store.intelrealsense.com/buy-intel-realsense-depth-camera-d415.html) cameras. All tests were performed on Raspberry 4 model B with Raspbian Buster.

Keep in mind that if you want better performance on resolution you must use USB3.0.
